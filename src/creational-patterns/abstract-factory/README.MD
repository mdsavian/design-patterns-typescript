# Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The main difference between a Factory Method and an Abstract Factory is that the factory method is a single method, and an abstract factory is an object. The factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass, whereas the abstract factory is an object that has multiple factory methods on it.

In the example we have a mobile factory, the factory created smartphones and tablets.

In the Apple factory, we create Iphones and Ipads and in the Samsung factory, we create Galaxy and Galaxy Tab.
