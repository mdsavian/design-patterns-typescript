## ðŸ“‘ Overview

This repository was created to understand how design patterns work, and how to apply them with [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).

As I use Typescript in my projects and in my current job, I chose it to implement the patterns.

All the patterns have their respective folder and inside we can take a look at the `README.md` file to get a description of the pattern.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

First, make sure you have installed a recent [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version (Node 14.x or later) and the classic [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/docs/install) dependency manager.

After setting everything up, clone this repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mdsavian/design-patterns-typescript.git
```

Install all dependencies:

```
$ yarn bootstrap
```

Run the specific pattern you want:

```
$ npx ts-node ./src/creational-patterns/factory-method/index.ts
```

And enjoy it! ;)

## ðŸ§ª Tests

For testing, I use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to make sure I am making good code and to understand if my implementation is working as expected.

To run tests, just run the command:

```
$ yarn test
```
